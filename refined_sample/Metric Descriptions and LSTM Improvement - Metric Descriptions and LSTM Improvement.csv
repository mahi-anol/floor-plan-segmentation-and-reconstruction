Metric,Description
TP (True Positive),The number of positive instances correctly predicted by the model.
TN (True Negative),The number of negative instances correctly predicted by the model.
FP (False Positive),The number of negative instances incorrectly labeled as positive (Type I Error).
FN (False Negative),The number of positive instances incorrectly labeled as negative (Type II Error).
DSC (Dice Score),The harmonic mean of Precision and Recall; measures the overlap between prediction and ground truth.
IoU (Intersection over Union),The ratio of the overlap area to the total area of both prediction and ground truth combined.
ACC (Accuracy),The ratio of total correct predictions (both positive and negative) to the total number of cases.
BACC (Balanced Accuracy),The arithmetic mean of Sensitivity and Specificity; useful for datasets with class imbalance.
ARI (Adjusted Rand Index),"A measure of similarity between two data groupings, adjusted for the probability of matching by chance."
AUC (Area Under Curve),The probability that the model ranks a random positive example higher than a random negative example.
KAP (Cohen’s Kappa),"A statistic that measures inter-rater agreement for categorical items, accounting for agreement by chance."
Sensitivity (Recall),The proportion of actual positives that were correctly identified by the model.
Specificity,The proportion of actual negatives that were correctly identified by the model.
PREC (Precision),The proportion of positive identifications that were actually correct.
VS (Volumetric Similarity),Compares the volume of predicted vs. ground truth segments without regard for their spatial overlap.
MCC (Matthews Correlation Coefficient),A correlation coefficient between observed and predicted binary classifications; balances all four confusion matrix quadrants.
nMCC (Normalized MCC),The MCC score rescaled (usually to a 0 to 1 range) to allow for easier comparison with other metrics.
aMCC (Adjusted MCC),A modified version of MCC designed to provide a more robust score in cases of extreme class imbalance.
